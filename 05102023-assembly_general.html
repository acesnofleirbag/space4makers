Assembly General
---

Each architecture has your own operation code (opcode) that is an instruction set supported by the processor arch

# Processor

The processor has the following steps:

- fetch
- decode
- exec cycle

# Why I need to make the memory alignment?

The reason for this is that the processor requires two memory accesses to make an unaligned memory access; aligned
accesses require only one memory access. A word (2-byte) or doubleword (4-byte) operand that crosses a 4-byte boundary
or a quadword (8-byte) operand that crosses an 8-byte boundary is considered unaligned and requires two separate memory
bus cycles for access

# Cheatsheets

- The instruction i++ otherwise ++i use one more instruction on generated assembly code, for a simple increment
    outside a for block for instance. Inside a for block the generated asm were the same
- Syscall numbers can be found on '/usr/include/asm/unistd.h'
