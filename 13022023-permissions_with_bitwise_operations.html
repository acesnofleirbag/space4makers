Permissions With Bitwise Operations
---

Looking on the sqlite3 source code I discover a way to manage permissions on a software using the bitwise operators,
more precisely the left shift operation

let's say that, as common, in your application you have some categories of permissions, e.g: 


- admin
- employee
- user


for each category is attributed a value


- admin = 1
- employee = 2
- user = 3


for each category will exists sub-categories related with this principal category, like:


- admin
    - a1
    - a2
- employee
    - e1
    - e2
- user
    - u1
    - u2


until here nothing different, but how can be possible to assign the correct value of this sub-category without values
duplication for persistency on a database, for instance?

For this it's possible to assign the correct value without duplication supposing that is reserved 64-bits to represent
the permission as following:


main category value | (sub-category code &lt;&lt; quantity of bits reserved only for the main category)


suppossing that we need to calculate the correct value to represent the category 'admin &gt; a1'


1 | 1 &lt;&lt; 8 (1 byte for the main category representation, that's the value max value of 256) = 257


now the sub-category 'admin &gt; a1' is equals the value 257 for representation


- admin
    - a1 = 257
    - a2


this method can represents '(2 ** (64 - 8)) / (2 ** 8)' sub-categories

- need to exclude the main categories representation (1 byte) from the total of bytes to all available space (8 bytes)
- need to divide the total by the numbers of principal categories
