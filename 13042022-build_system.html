Build System
---

It's a tool that makes the management of source code producing a binary accordingly the specs defined on the build
system's config file

# How To Use This?

In this text we will cover about 'cmake' usage, the cmake config file is 'CMakeLists.txt'

To start with cmake we need first define a cmake version like that

<div class="code">
// the latest version when this text was writed was the 3.10 version
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
</div>

after cmake version is defined we will set some variables

<div class="code">
// we will set this variable to change this only on time in the cmake file specs, and reuse this variable when necessary
set(PROJECT "project-name")

// this define the compiler to *.cpp files
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "unix-path-to-binary")
</div>

now we can define some metadata about current project 

<div class="code">
project(
    ${PROJECT}
    VERSION 1.0.0
    DESCRIPTION "project description"
    LANGUAGES CXX
)
</div>

it's necessary to define how the build system will produce the binary file and what files will be used to produce the
binary

<div class="code">
add_executable(
    ${PROJECT}
    # here we list all necessaries files in the compilation to program start
    # correctly as expected
    main.cpp
    *.cpp
)
</div>

and in cmake we have some special function that defines the compiler behavior, always stating with 'target_*' 
(all target_* function need to be defined after executable definition inside 'add_executable' function)

<div class="code">
// used to setup the compiler standard
target_compile_features(${PROJECT} PRIVATE cxx_std_20)

// used to setup compiler flags options
target_compile_options(
    ${PROJECT}
    PRIVATE
    -Wall
    -Werror
    -Wextra
    -Weffc++
    -Wsign-conversion
    -Wimplicit-fallthrough
)
</div>

to finish as basic knowledge, we can produce a cmake config file aggregation defining another config file inside a
project subfolder and compose these files with the following function

<div class="code">
add_subdirectory(path-to-sub-directory-to-be-aggregated)
</div>

to generate the binary we have some methods to do that:

- default usage

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

- using ninja

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -G Ninja ..
$ ninja
