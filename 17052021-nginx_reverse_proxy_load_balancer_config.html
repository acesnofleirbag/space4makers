---

# Configuration File

The nginx config file is located on: '/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf'

# Working As Reverse Proxy

To work as reverse poroxy inside the config file it's necessary the following rules:


location {
   proxy_pass http://&lt;address&gt;;
}


# Working As Load Balancer

To work as load balancer inside the config file it's necessary the following rules:

- create a server group


upstream &lt;upstream-name&gt; {
   server &lt;address1&gt;;
   server &lt;address2&gt;;
}


- setup the server group


location {
   proxy_pass http://&lt;upstream-name&gt;;

   // forward the real request ip address
   proxy_set_headers X-Header-Name $remote_addr;
}


Obs: Inside the workers on '/etc/nginx/nginx.conf' it's necessary to put the header inside the object 'http' on
