# GRAPHQL

_for a better understanding of the main concepts of GraphQL will be used a
comparison with the resful pattern_

### Definition

The GraphQL it's one of the possible way of communication between services
together
the REST (REpresentational State Transfer) pattern and gRPC (Remote
Procedure Call) are the most used nowadays

### Default Types

- **Query:** is the default type of search in a GraphQL API, compared to the
  REST would be the `GET` method
- **Mutation:** is the default type of modifications in a GraphQL API, compared
  to the REST would be the `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` methods

## Defining Custom Types

Case it's necessary defines a specific type for your implementation we do as
follows 

```
type User {
   name String!
   email String!
   username String
}
```

We use the keyword `type` to tell it's will be a new type in the
application, in case we will have a user with the follows attributes `name`,
`email`, and `username`. Note that the attribute `username` don't finish with
`!`, this means that the attribute is optional while the others are
mandatory

**passing parameters**

Case it's necessary pass parameters we do as follows way:

```
user(id: Int!): User!
```

In this example our "endpoint" returns a user based on your `ID`

### Resolvers

Are functions what will be executed when a "endpoint" is called, it's in
resolvers that the implementation about what will be returned happens

The resolvers can receive 3 (three) parameters, being them: root,
arguments and context, that translating for our example with
[ariadne](https://ariadnegraphql.org/) would stay object, infos and context

```python
def resolve_endpoint(obj, info, context):
   """ implementation """
   ...
```

### Python Usage

Has a lot of available libs for Python but in our example will be use
the ariadne, this is the get start example of ariadne's docs

``` python
from ariadne import QueryType, gql, make_executable_schema
from ariadne.asgi import GraphQL

type_defs = gql("""
   type Query {
      hello: String!
   }
""")

# Create type instance for Query type defined in our schema...
query = QueryType()


# ...and assign our resolver function to its "hello" field.
@query.field("hello")
def resolve_hello(_, info):
   request = info.context["request"]
   user_agent = request.headers.get("user-agent", "guest")

   return "Hello, %s!" % user_agent

schema = make_executable_schema(type_defs, query)
app = GraphQL(schema, debug=True)
```
