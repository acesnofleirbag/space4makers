# ATOMIC DESIGN

### What's Atomic Design

Atomic design it's a one frontend organization way based on an analogy with the
periodic table we have 5 (five) differents sections:

1. Atoms
2. Molecules
3. Organisms
4. Templates
5. Pages

### Atoms

Atoms are the smaller elements of frontend composition, we have as example:

- buttons
- inputs
- labels

### Molecules

Isolated atoms by itself it's not very useful, although merged can produce the
most interesting elements, producing what we call as molecules - molecules must
have unique actions - we have as example:

- search bar

### Organisms

Organisms how can you imagine are compounds of molecules, in this moment the
element pass to have a greater complexity being able to have multiples actions,
we have as example:

- header
- footer

### Templates

Templates are predefined pieces and keeps a reusable code structure where it's
possible to perform "arguments injection" to build most embracing layouts

### Pages

The final planned layout can be drawn through wireframes or other design
interface's techniques, using all above topics for this
