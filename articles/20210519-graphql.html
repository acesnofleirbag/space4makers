GraphQL
===

For a better understanding of the main concepts of GraphQL will be used a
comparison with the resful pattern

Definition
---

The GraphQL it's one of the possible way of communication between services
together the REST (REpresentational State Transfer) pattern and gRPC (Remote
Procedure Call) are the most used nowadays

Default Types
---

- Query: is the default type of search in a GraphQL API, compared to the REST
would be the `GET` method

- Mutation: is the default type of modifications in a GraphQL API, compared to
the REST would be the 'POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE' methods

Defining Custom Types
---

Case it's necessary defines a specific type for your implementation we do as
follows 

<code>
type User {
   name String!
   email String!
   username String
}
</code>

We use the keyword 'type' to tell it's will be a new type in the application, in
case we will have a user with the follows attributes 'name', 'email', and
'username'. Note that the attribute 'username' don't finish with '!', this means
that the attribute is optional while the others are mandatory

- Passing parameters

Case it's necessary pass parameters we do as follows way:

<code>
user(id: Int!): User!
</code>

In this example our "endpoint" returns a user based on your 'ID'

Resolvers
---

Are functions what will be executed when a "endpoint" is called, it's in
resolvers that the implementation about what will be returned happens

The resolvers can receive 3 (three) parameters, being them: root, arguments and
context, that translating for our example with https://ariadnegraphql.org/ would
stay object, infos and context

<code>
def resolve_endpoint(obj, info, context):
   """ implementation """
   ...
</code>

Python Usage
---

Has a lot of available libs for Python but in our example will be use the
ariadne, this is the get start example of ariadne's docs

<code>
from ariadne import QueryType, gql, make_executable_schema
from ariadne.asgi import GraphQL

type_defs = gql("""
   type Query {
      hello: String!
   }
""")

# Create type instance for Query type defined in our schema...
query = QueryType()


# ...and assign our resolver function to its "hello" field.
@query.field("hello")
def resolve_hello(_, info):
   request = info.context["request"]
   user_agent = request.headers.get("user-agent", "guest")

   return "Hello, %s!" % user_agent

schema = make_executable_schema(type_defs, query)
app = GraphQL(schema, debug=True)
</code>
