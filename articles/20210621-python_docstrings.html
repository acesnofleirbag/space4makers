Python Docstrings
===

A built-in form to write documentations

What's Docstrings?
---

Docstring it's a built-in documentation form of classes, functions, modules, etc
in Python. Help us to describe anything without to pollute the code with
comments, leaving comments more specifics like: TODO, FIXME, etc ...

Google's Standard
---

The standard that I recommend you to use is the Google Dosctring['0], it's
really clean and very objective. I makes some changes on default docstring
format, e.g:

<code>
class GoogleDocstring:
    """
    google dosctring implementation example

    Attributes:
        - language (str): The knowledge programming language
        - version (float): Version of the provided programming language
        - open_source (bool): Describe if the provided programming language is open source

    Methods:
        - lorem_ipsum: Return a lorem ipsum string to stdout
        - good_morning: Display a good morning string for stdout, if the time is between 07:00am and 11:59am

    Exceptions:
        - InvalidTime: Happens when the current time is not between a valid time

    Business Rules:
        - Need to print "good morning" only if the current time is between 07:00am and 11:59am

    Other Sections:
    Here we can put others compatibles sections like:
        - Filters: If this abstraction can be filtered
        - TODO: Todo items
        - Note: Implement notes for the client
        - Others from your preference, be creative ...
    """

    # Implementation after one empty line from docstring
    # ...
</code>

Why To Use Docstring Otherwise Comments?
---

Comments are not interpreted by the Python as the docstring are, when we declare
a docstring on a function, like:

<code>
def lorem_ipsum() -> None:
    """Display 'lorem ipsum' to stdout"""
    ...
</code>

if there is any question about function usage (of course you can inspect the
code) we can just make a 'print' on the function's documentation, e.g:

<code>
print(lorem_ipsum.__doc__)

# Execution

&gt;&gt;&gt; Display 'lorem ipsum' to stdout
</code>

* Tip: We can use the 'help' function too, passing the function 'lorem_ipsum' as
an argument *

Where To Implement
---

Implement docstrings on all places can be very tedious task and we know that not
always we can implement the documentation in all softwares that we produces, so
in my opinion we can implement the docstring in 2 (two) key moments:

- When has the involvement on business rules 

When we have a function, method or class that implements any business rules it's
a good moment to implement the docstrings because like that others developers
that will be makes the code maintenance will be aware that on this function a
business rule is implemented and need a more attention on code changes

- When you code is complex

Complex code (if your code is complex can be a good signal to refactor this and
makes the code more simple) can cause a lot of questions on more inexperienced
colaborators, and in some cases on the more experienced colaborators too, it's a
good moment to use the docstring to give some context about the implementation

Script Usage
---

Not always it's a good ideia to implement a documentation on a script that have
a fast and single usage, however if this script will be used more that 1 (one)
time can be a good ideia to implement a documentation. Follow an example of a
script documentation following the Shell Script Profissional by Aurelio Marinho

<code>
"""
#!/usr/bin/env python

battery_notifier.py - Display the current battery status from a GNU/Linux system

This script display in STDOUT the battery status, only works on a GNU/Linux system,
for more instructions run with '-h' argument

Usage:
    $ ./battery_notifier.py
    or
    $ python battery_notifier.py
