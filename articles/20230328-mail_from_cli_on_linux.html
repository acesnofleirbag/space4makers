Mail From CLI
===

To send an email from the cli it's necessary to configure a mail transfer agent
(MTA), for this we'll use the postfix agent (with a gmail account in mind).

To install the postfix run (debian based distros):

<code>
$ sudo apt install postfix
</code>

on the installation process you'll be asked to input a fully qualified domain
name (FQDN), on this step you can ignore with an empty string and answering
'yes' on the next window frame

Create a new file on '/etc/postfix/sasl/sasl_passwd' and insert the following
content:

<code>
[smtp.gmail.com]:587 [mail-addr]@gmail.com:[password]
</code>

Switch '[mail-addr]' and '[password]' with the correct value of your account.
After that generate a db file (this file need to be access only by the root
user with the `0600` permission) with the following command:

<code>
$ sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl/sasl_passwd
</code>

a new file 'sasl_passwd.db' will be generated on the same directory.

Insert the content on the '/etc/postfix/main.cf':

<code>
relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl/sasl_passwd
smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt
smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
</code>

To fisish restart the service

<code>
$ sudo systemctl restart postfix
</code>

To send an email, using the sendmail utility

<code>
$ sendmail [address] < msg.txt
</code>

The file msg.txt has the following format

<code>
To: addr@mail.com
From: "Alias" &lt;addr@mail.com&gt;
Date: Mon, 01 Jan 2000 12:00:00 -0300
Subject: Email subject
Cc: addr@mail.com

&lt;message body&gt;
</code>
