Programming Paradigms
===

Imperative vs Declarative
---

Imperative

- Focus in the workflow
- Mutable state
- How?
- Greater code quantity
- Low level of scalability
- More explicit

Declarative

- Focus in the logic
- Imutability
- What?
- Less code quantity
- High level of scalability
- Less explicit

OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
---

The object oriented programming consists in 4 (four) pillars:

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

- Abstraction: Nothing more than the form how anything on real world will be
treated on the code, in other words, how will be the behavior and the
characteristics of anything on the software

- Encapsulation: Treat of the access part inside the OOP, isolating the object
properties of an object to not have a direct access to this properties

- Inheritance: Give us the possibility of a "children" object to have the same
properties and behaviors of a "father" object reducing the code repetition

- Polimorphism: Permits that the behavior of an object be different depending of
what params this object receive

Have too the composition concept otherwise the inheritance, to understand in a
better way this concept I recommend the study of the GOF (gang of four) design
patterns. A good resource for this is the Refactoring Guru['0]

Functional Programming
---

The functional programming it's a oriented function strategy, with that we have:

- Pure Functions: Don't modify the scope around, receive or not params and with
this it's possible the function chain. The use of pure functions grant a better
predictability to the software

- Impure Functions: Modify the scope around making hard the software
predictability. With example, given any parameter this function create a element
inside the DOM (Document Object Model), that is, this relation is not inside the
function scope therefore ouw function would be impure

- First Class Function: Are functions that can be passes as parameter to another
functions and would be returned from another function, become as "variables"
inside the function

- High Other Function: Are functions that permits other functions as parameter
and can or not returns functions as result

- Currying: It's a form to pass parameters in a partial way to a function making
with that each parameter become a function with only one parameter

- Imutability: The data not be direct changed, the data is cpoied to another
memory space to have a updated version of the data

obs: A disadvantage of the functional programming it's that increase the memory
usage in relation of another paradigms justly because of the imutability

Procedural Programming
---

- Execution Stack: A function stack it's formed to be executed

- Scope: Was when the scoper concept was introduced on the software development
but this scope was the global scope, that is, a function would be modify the
scope around itself
