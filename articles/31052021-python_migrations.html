Python Migrations
===

Ever needed to create database migrations in Python and didn't know where to
start?

What's Migrations?
---

Migrations is a mode to realize a database versioning, the form how the database
was implemented with your tables and tables's configurations

Are very powerful and very used because permits that in 1 (one) or on max 2
(two) commands we have the database's structure created, so much for testing or
project's initialization in case of the first contact 

Alembic
---

Alembic['0] it's a Python module that give us the possibility to execute the
migrations in a easy way, we make this following the follows steps:

- alembic init 

Is used to init the alembic configuration file on project (run this command on
project root folder)

<code>
$ alembic init migrations
</code>

on this moment will be created a folder called 'migrations' and the file
'alembic.ini' on project root folder, go to the file 'alembic.ini' and pass the
database connection string, e.g:

* This step can have variations following the project's configuration *

<code>
sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///database/storage.db
</code>

- Defining the migration

Here will be created a table to a user abstraction 'User', to this execute:

<code>
$ alembic revision -m "create: users table"
</code>

now on the path 'migrations/versios' we can find a file similar to this: '11f0db5a01cb_create_user_table.py'

editing the file on function 'upgrade', we have the following result:

<code>
# ...

def upgrade():
    op.create_table(
        "users",
        sa.Column(
            "id",
            sa.String(length = 64),
            nullable = False,
            default = lambda: str(uuid4())
        ),
        sa.Column("name", sa.String(length = 255), nullable = True),
        sa.Column("email", sa.String(length = 255), nullable = False),
        sa.Column(
            "created_at",
            sa.TIMESTAMP(),
            nullable = False,
            default = lambda: datetime.today()
        ),
        sa.UniqueConstraint("id")
    )

# ...
</code>

and to reverse the 'upgrade' action, we change the 'downgrade' on the following
form:

<code>
# ...

def downgrade():
    op.drop_table("users")
# ...
</code>

It's ready, this is suficient, we have our table 'users'. To execute the
migration just execute:

<code>
$ alembic upgrade head
</code>

to revert the action just run: 

<code>
$ alembic downgrade base
</code>

Seeds
---

Seeds are pre-defined data to insert on the created tables, we can perform the
seeds creation editing the 'upgrade' function:

<code>
from alembic import op, context

# ...

def upgrade():
    users = op.create_table(
        "users",
        sa.Column(
            "id",
            sa.String(length = 64),
            nullable = False,
            default = lambda: str(uuid4())
        ),
        sa.Column("name", sa.String(length = 255), nullable = True),
        sa.Column("email", sa.String(length = 255), nullable = False),
        sa.Column(
            "created_at",
            sa.TIMESTAMP(),
            nullable = False,
            default = lambda: datetime.today()
        ),
        sa.UniqueConstraint("id")
    )

    if context.get_x_argument(as_dictionary = True).get("seed"):
        op.bulk_insert(
            users,
            [
                {
                    "name": "Bart Simpsons",
                    "email": "bart@mail.com"
                }
            ]
        )

# ...
</code>

and when we need of the seeds' data it's just to execute:

<code>
$ alembic -x seed=true upgrade head
$ alembic -x seed=true downgrade base
</code>
